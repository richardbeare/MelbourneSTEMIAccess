Welcome to the simulated maps for patient access to ST elevation
myocardial infarction (STEMI) services in Melbourne, Victoria. These
interactive maps display the region serviced by a hospital under
various service models - i.e. number of hospitals. Links
at the top of this page allow access to maps displaying different
service models.

Please note that these maps were based on estimates of travel time
from random addresses to the major hospitals using Google Maps and
were not based on real ambulance transits.
